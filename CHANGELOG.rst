v3.0.0 (2020-12-01)
-------------------

Added
^^^^^

- Functions to add arguments from classes, methods and functions.
- CLI function that allows creating a line command line interface with a single
  line of code inspired by Fire.
- Typing module that includes predefined types and type generator functions
  for paths and restricted numbers/strings.
- Extended support to add_argument type to allow complex type hints.
- Parsers now include --print_config option to dump defaults.
- Support argcomplete for tab completion of arguments.


Changed
^^^^^^^

- ArgumentParsers by default now use as error_handler the
  usage_and_exit_error_handler.
- error_handler and formatter_class no longer accept as value a string.
- Changed SimpleNamespace to Namespace to avoid unnecessary differences with
  argparse.

  restricted number types.
