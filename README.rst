yamlargparse python module
==========================

This module is an extension to python's argparse which simplifies parsing of
configuration options from command line arguments, yaml configuration files,
environment variables and hard-coded defaults.

The aim is similar to other projects such as `configargparse
<https://pypi.org/project/ConfigArgParse/>`_, `yconf
<https://pypi.org/project/yconf/>`_ and `confuse
<https://pypi.org/project/confuse/>`_. The obvious question is, why yet another
module similar to many already existing ones? The answer is simply that none of
the existing projects had the exact features we wanted and after analyzing the
alternatives it seemed simpler to create a new module.
